name = "jeremiah"

#we can change the value of name to be something else eg
name = "bako"

print (name)

#we changed the value of name from Jeremiah to bako
#but we cannot change the characters in the spelling of Jeremia eg
# name = "jeremiah"
# name[0] = "g" #trying to change fomr jeremiah to geremiah
#print(name) it will give erroe as tring objects not suppor item assignmemt
#so we cannot change the characters in a string once it is created

#the only way we can change a string value is to reassign a new value eg

age = 33

age = 20

print(age) #here we reassigned a new value to age or 

score = 30

score = score + 10
print(score)
